Car Dealership System

We've made this system as an assignment for our Software Engineering course. 
The system uses Java as the main language. The frontend has been designed using JavaFX.
The purpose of designing the system is to demonstrate a solid understanding of good design practices and to experiment with Agile software development and SCRUM.
